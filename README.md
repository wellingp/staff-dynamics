Simple, yet effective, professional site made for a bookkeeping business.

## Project Details

### Project Start Date
30-11-2022

#### Motivation

I reached out to a local small business that I thought might benefit from 
expanding their online presence. The client revealed that she actually had
a domain name and web host, but hadn't set it up and wasn't quite sure how. 

As such, we decided on a flexible plan wherein two versions of the site would 
be made: one using code, and one using the Hostinger site builder. This way, 
she can choose whether she prefers using the site builder, or whether she 
feels she can handle the coded site with her modest code experience.

Aesthetically, she was flexible and did not have much preference as to how it 
looked as long as there was an emphasis on seniors since that is her primary 
clientele. With that in mind, I designed the site with large, easy to read type, 
high contrast, and a simple, easy to use UI.
